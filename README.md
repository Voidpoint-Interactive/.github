# Voidpoint Interactive
We are an indie game development team that prioritises quality over quantity.  
With numerous project ideas, our team is filled with excitement for our future.  
## What are we currently working on?
The project that is currently at the furthest stage of development is an exciting first title.  
Inspired by the world of Hyrule, Everwonder will take you to our version of this mysterious kingdom.  
Currently in its concept stage, Everwonder is beginning to stir up wonder and awe in our minds.  
*Ever wonder what it's like to be stuck in a world you know nothing of?*  
You play as a misplaced adventurer (wanderer) who finds themself lost  
in a mysterious world with no recollection of where they come from  
or who they are. 
## When can I get my hands on this game?
The team at Voidpoit want to deliver the best possible experience and  
know that game dev takes time.  
That is why we believe that for the game to meet expectations, we need to work at our own pace.  
This means, as a team, we can work on the game when we have the time, allowing for our  
personal lives to take priority.  
We know that many people are itching to play our game, and we will do our best  
to deliver a polished experience as soon as possible, allowing you to enjoy it.  
We're aiming to polish a vertical slice of the game before developing its bulk.
